### 🔭 I’m currently working on
> Leading a simulated semiconductor New Product Introduction (NPI) program—developing all program artifacts (project charters, PRDs, risk registers, stakeholder matrices, and dashboards) to showcase my technical program management expertise.

> Designing and refining a data consistency & anomaly detection automation tool in Python, targeting robust data quality for industrial and automotive use cases.

> Driving cross-functional student leadership as President of the NCPMI Student Club @ NC State, organizing real-world tech workshops bridging industry and academia.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- End-to-end VLSI design flow (Spec, RTL, Verification, Synthesis, Physical Design) and semiconductor business strategies
- Hands-on skills in Qiskit for quantum algorithms, and TensorFlow for AI-driven optimization
- Advanced project delivery methodologies used in automotive and hardware/software integration environments

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Embedded and AI-driven automation projects for data reliability, hardware-in-the-loop testing, or mobility solutions
- Portfolio/personal projects that require structured program plans involving multidisciplinary teams (software, hardware, product)
- Open-source efforts focused on improving accessibility and technical education for engineers

### 🤔 I’m looking for help with
- Navigating the transition into full-time Technical Program Manager roles in the semiconductor or automotive space (referrals, mentorship, real-world insights)
- Validating my simulated NPI program materials—feedback from current TPMs on artifact quality, metrics, and stakeholder management approaches

### 💬 Ask me about
- How to structure and execute large-scale technical programs in highly-regulated industries
- Turning ambiguous requirements into actionable milestones and metrics for product success
- Delivering cross-functional outcomes with distributed teams in fast-paced, complex hardware/software environments
